This is a learning project for me to implement an OIDC-compliant Identity Provider.

This file is the only file in this repository that is 100% handwritten by me. The rest of the files will have some mix of my code and LLM code.

I will use AI assistance to learn and to implement this. However, I will implement interesting parts of the code myself. The end goal is to use this server as a federated Identity Provider for AWS Cognito.

In general, the /plans directory contains a plan for a day in DD-MM-YYYY format, so I can track my progress as I gradually focus on each specific target.

This is also a learning ground for me to master new shiny AI-assisted coding tools, such as Cursor and Claude Code.
